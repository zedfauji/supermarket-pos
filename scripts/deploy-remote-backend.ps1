.SYNOPSIS
    Deploys all 12 required Supabase Edge Functions and sets the required production
    secrets on the remote project mkvinyekkyennyegfoxq (Phase 20: Store Deployment,
    DEP-03/DEP-04).

.DESCRIPTION
    One-time/idempotent ops tooling, safely re-runnable — not part of the app or CI.
    `supabase functions deploy` (no function name) bulk-deploys every function under
    supabase/functions/ in one call, and `supabase secrets set --env-file` upserts
    secrets from a .env-format file without wiping ones not listed (RESEARCH.md
    Assumption A1). Neither section is destructive; re-running either is safe.

    Fails fast: exits non-zero with a specific message on the FIRST failing check,
    rather than continuing past a failure and producing a partial pass. Exits 0 with
    "All checks passed" only when every check in both sections holds.

    Section 1 (this script's Task 1 portion) — DEP-03:
      1. Asserts supabase/.temp/project-ref (if present) matches the hardcoded
         expected project ref, so this never deploys to an unverified project.
      2. Asserts the `supabase` CLI is on PATH.
      3. Asserts supabase/functions/ contains all 12 required function directories.
      4. Prints a one-line audit confirming the config.toml verify_jwt default is
         correct for all 12 functions (no public/unauthenticated function exists).
      5. Runs `supabase functions deploy --project-ref <ref>` (bulk).
      6. Runs `supabase functions list --project-ref <ref>` and asserts the returned
         name set is exactly the 12 required names.
      7. Reachability smoke-check: an unauthenticated GET to each function's live
         HTTPS URL. A 404 with the literal Supabase "Requested function was not
         found" body means undeployed -> Fail. Any other status (401/400/405/etc)
         means the function exists and rejected the unauthenticated call for an
         unrelated reason (expected -- every one of these 12 functions requires an
         authenticated supabase.functions.invoke() session) -> counts as reachable.

         Deviation from the original design note below both sections: fetching the
         project anon key (either via the Supabase MCP tool or via
         `supabase projects api-keys`) was not available in this execution
         environment (no MCP server session; the CLI command is blocked by this
         environment's own sandboxing policy since it can print live secret key
         material). This is not needed for the check's actual logic -- a plain
         unauthenticated request already reliably returns 401
         ("Missing authorization header") for every deployed function in this app
         and 404 ("Requested function was not found") only for a genuinely
         undeployed one, which is exactly the distinction this check needs to make.
         Confirmed empirically against all 12 real deployed functions before this
         script was written.

    Section 2 (Task 3) -- DEP-04: appended below the "Secrets (DEP-04)" marker.
