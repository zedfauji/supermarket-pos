.SYNOPSIS
    Verifies a real, elevated Windows deployment of the store print broker
    (Phase 19: Store-Local Durable Printing Service).

.DESCRIPTION
    This is a scripted artifact, not a checkpoint: this repo's CLAUDE.md
    testing policy requires automating verification rather than asking a
    human to click through the app, and the executing agent's own shell has
    no admin rights on a real target machine to run these elevated checks
    itself (per .planning/spikes/CONVENTIONS.md's "Elevation boundary" note).
    Run this script elevated, on the real deployed store machine, after the
    NSIS installer's post-install hook (windows/hooks.nsh) has completed.

    Fails fast: exits non-zero with a specific message on the FIRST failing
    check, rather than continuing past a failure and producing a partial
    pass. Exits 0 with "All checks passed" only when all five checks hold.

    Checks, in order:
      1. Get-Service PrintBrokerService reports Status=Running and
         StartType=Automatic.
      2. Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='broker.exe'" shows
         SessionId=0 — proves genuine SCM management (a service process
         always runs in Session 0), not a stray manually-started process
         (.planning/spikes/CONVENTIONS.md's SessionId/ParentProcessId
         pattern).
      3. Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Store Print Broker" exists and its
         associated port filter shows LocalPort=8973/Protocol=TCP.
      4. $env:ProgramData\PrintBroker\client-secret.txt exists and is
         non-empty.
      5. An HTTP GET to http://127.0.0.1:8973/health returns {"ok":true}.
